# Choice of Database
* Initially chosen as SQLite due to the ease of integrating with Python Flask framework and easy hosting in PythonAnywhere.com
* Switched to NoSQL, specifically MongoDB, because NoSQL prioritises BASE over ACID, and therefore, high availability over data integrity, which is more in line with the application requirements

# Choice of Back-End Framework
* Python Flask over Express.js and Node.JS
* Security—Python Flask has far fewer dependencies than MERN
* Development environment—some potential Node dependencies are not yet optimised for the Apple Silicon, and the hackathon environment is not the best time to be dealing with equipment problems.  Hence, Python Flask which has fewer dependencies is chosen as this reduces the risk of delay in a hackathon environment
